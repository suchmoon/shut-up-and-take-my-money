A: ION was created by [url=https://archive.is/DwOBH#selection-515.0-515.279]a team[/url] that tried to prop Paycoin (XPY) up for a year after GAW's demise, XPY being the extension of the [url=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-271.html]hashlet ponzi scheme[/url] perpetrated by GAW owner/CEO Homero Joshua Garza. In April 2016 the team declared XPY dead, created their own new coin ION, rebranded [url=https://archive.is/fLZZf]xpy.io[/url] online wallet to ionomy.com, and converted xpy.io XPY balances to ION.

[url=https://i.snag.gy/DS3MnU.jpg]Bureaucratic reasons[/url] are blamed for the issue.

Q: How will the team work around [url=https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html]Google Play[/url] and [url=https://developer.apple.com/terms/]Apple[/url] rules prohibiting the use of third-party payment methods (such as ION) in mobile games?
A: [url=https://i.snag.gy/DS3MnU.jpg]The team claims[/url] to have no issues with Google, and Apple will evaluate compliance once the games are submitted to the store. The solution appears to be based on using non-blockchain non-monetary tokens (electrons) in games, instead of using ION directly.

Q: Does the team provide any status updates or other information?
A: Some limited information may surface on [url=https://ionomy.slack.com/]ionomy slack[/url] however due to lack of structure, required login, and limited retention it is difficult to locate and impossible to link to slack postings. Status updates are sometimes emailed to [url=https://ionomy.com/]ionomy.com[/url] users and there is a rarely updated [url=https://ionomy.com/news]news page[/url].  Some investors [url=https://archive.is/dSAR6#selection-5939.0-5943.3]have claimed[/url] to have access to privileged information, including financial details and business plans by virtue of being "whales" (large investors).
